# 🌾 Crop Yield & Sustainability Insights Dashboard (1997 – 2020)

A dynamic and data-driven Power BI dashboard designed to visualize and analyze 24 years of agricultural performance trends across India, focusing on yield efficiency, fertilizer and pesticide usage, rainfall correlation, and crop-wise sustainability indicators.

---

## 🎯 Purpose / Description

The **Crop Yield & Sustainability Insights Dashboard** helps policymakers, analysts, and agricultural researchers evaluate the long-term relationship between rainfall, fertilizer and pesticide use, and crop productivity.
It enables users to identify production trends, monitor input efficiency, and explore region- and season-specific insights to support data-driven agricultural planning and resource optimization.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

* **📊 Power BI Desktop** – Core visualization platform for dashboard creation and interactivity
* **⚙️ Power Query** – Data extraction, transformation, and cleaning from multiple structured data sources
* **🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Calculated measures for KPIs, dynamic filters, and year-over-year insights
* **📁 File Format:** `.pbix` for development and `.png` for presentation

---

## 🌐 Data Source

**Source:** Government of India – Directorate of Economics & Statistics and Ministry of Agriculture (1997 – 2020)

**Dataset Details:**

* Historical crop production, yield, fertilizer usage, and rainfall data for major Indian states and crops
* Annual records covering Kharif, Rabi, and other seasonal segments
* Aggregated to support comparative trend analysis across years and regions

---

## 🌟 Features / Highlights

### • Business Problem

India’s agricultural sector faces the dual challenge of increasing productivity while ensuring sustainability. Stakeholders needed a unified view to analyze how rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide inputs impact crop yield and production trends over time.

### • Goal of the Dashboard

To build an interactive, state-wise, and crop-wise analytical dashboard that reveals:

* Yield and production growth patterns from 1997 to 2020
* Dependency between rainfall and fertilizer usage
* Top performing states and crops by average yield
* Seasonal distribution of crops and input efficiency
